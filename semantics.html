			<p>An important convention of web design is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/web/web_semantic.asp">semantics</a>. Ideally, the HTML for a page would contain nothing but markup. Each component of the page would be "marked up" with its type, like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. Classes should be sparsely applied, as each element is likely to look the same throughout the site. But when pages are marked up using obscene amounts of nested divs, the semantics of the page are completely lost. A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is simply a division, and provides no clue as to its content.</p>
			<p>The Semantic CSS Framework is therefore very opinionated. That is, the code patterns are largely unalterable without a significant amount of restructuring. But in writing it, I have no desire to impose my opinions on its userbase. As many conventions as possible are just that: conventions. They are patterns that have been used by web designers for decades, or they are intuitively accurate. It boils down to this: if you want to do something different than what everyone else is doing, don't use a framework. If you're fine with doing the same thing as everyone else, at least agree on a way it should be done. The Semantic CSS Framework attempts to encapsulate what designers have come to agree on.</p>
